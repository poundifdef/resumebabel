This project is a series of scripts to convert a resume to any number of
output formats. JSON is the input, and each module outputs to a different
format.

One of the most tedious parts of applying to jobs is the resume. Everyone's
HR department accepts a different resume format.

LinkedIn (and other career websites) don't really help; HR still wants you 
to paste a plain-text resume into their little online job application.

If there is a format you want to see, feel free to write a template and make
a pull request! 

Supported formats:

   * JSON 
   * Plain text

Upcoming formats:

   * HTML with hResume (in progress)
   * LaTeX (in progress)
   * PDF
   * RTF
   * DOC
   * ...others? fork me on github!

Dependencies:

   * HTML, TXT templating: jinja (http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
   * phasing out: genshi (http://genshi.edgewall.org/)
